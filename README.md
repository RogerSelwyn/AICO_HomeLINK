# AICO HomeLINK integration for Home Assistant

The `homelink` platform allows you to view the status of your AICO alarm system.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Binary Sensor
  - Property status
  - Device status
- Sensor - Device last tested date

### [Buy Me A ~~Coffee~~ Beer üçª](https://buymeacoffee.com/rogtp)
I work on this integration because I like things to work well for myself and others, and for it to deliver as much as is achievable with the API. Please don't feel you are obligated to donate, but of course it is appreciated.
